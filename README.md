# Problem

Lack of access to books by under privileged schools and students. 

# Proposed Solution

A platform that connects people who have books to donate to schools or students that needs
these books. This might be people that are done with school, families that want to gave away books that their children used or other well meaning individuals.

Node, Express, Angular and MongoDB 

# Benefit

- This will help students to have access to great books that they could not afford.
- The platform will also help the environment as the owners of the book could have burnt it to create space in their homes.

- Provide a platform where philantropists, both international and local, can use to connect students who need their help.
- Increase the level of education in Nigeria.
